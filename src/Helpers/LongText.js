export const about = <div>
        My name is Edgar Gonzalez, I am 3rd-year Computer Science Major and Mathematics minor at Western Kentucky University. My focus in college is algorithms and theory, 
        but recently I have been studying full-stack web development on the side! I am of Hispanic background and was raised in the USA as well as having studied in Asia,
        this has helped me understand and connect with people from all over the world.
        <br/><br/>
        I enjoy solving difficult problems because of the satisfaction of being able to overcome my old self. 
        I also enjoy constantly learning new things which makes programming a great hobby since seemingly every day a new technology is released. 
        Aside from programming, I enjoy playing the piano and studying entrepreneurship.
